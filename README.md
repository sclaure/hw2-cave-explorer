# Cave Explorer

## Build Notes

Nothing Special is required to build my game. It should compile normally through jam

## Asset Pipeline

To create assets for my game, I edited pictures through GIMP, exported those edits as PNG files, and used the provided png load function to utilize those images as textures

## Architecture

The game pretty much has a sprite for the character that moves depending on whether or not its neighbors have been hardcoded in. As the character moves, the paths light up. The only difference between my game and the design is that 1 spaceis predetermined to be the treasure (not random), and the other "rocks" cannot be mined (despite the message below indicating so)

## Reflection

The assignment in my opinion was difficult because it was still unclear to me on how to swap textures (took me a long time to figure it out)
